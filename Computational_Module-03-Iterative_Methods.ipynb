As a gentler introduction to numerical methods, in this chapter we present a simple approach to numerically solving **ordinary differential equations**.

(We use a `while` loop rather than a `for` loop here because we don't know ahead of time how many cycles through the loop we need to make, but we do know the stopping condition -- the final time.)  Note that the `while` condition here is written as `t <= tf - dt` (`dt` is playing the role of $\\Delta t$ in the earlier equations).  This condition is *not* checking whether the time `t` is less than or equal to the final time `tf`, but whether it's less than or equal to the *earlier* time, `tf - dt`.  That's because the `while` loop is going to calculate the variable values at the *next* time step.  If the condition were `t <= tf`, then when `t` became equal to `tf` and the program entered the loop, the loop would then calculate the variable values at `tf + dt`, which would be beyond the desired range.  \n",

A reasonable rule of thumb might be to set the timestep to 1% or 0.1% of the total time expected for the motion and see how the results look and how long the computation takes.  If the results look poor or are not what was expected, decrease the time step by a factor of 5 or 10; if the results look good but the calculation takes too long, try increasing the timestep by a factor of 3 or 5.  \n",

To run it from the Python command line prompt, type the file name.  (The directory containing the file must be in your Python \"path\" variable.  If it's not, you will need to type the entire directory path of the file to identify it to Python; e.g. `python C:\\Users\\Anya\\Documents\\file.py`.)  To run it in an IPython notebook, you would type or copy the code, or sections of it, into code cells in the notebook and then run the cells in order, or else run the entire notebook.  There is no single protocol for how many lines of code should be placed in one notebook cell, but all the lines of a loop and all the lines of a user-defined function must be in one cell.  A reasonable approach might be for contiguous code lines of similar character (e.g., those initializing parameters, or those defining lists), or all of the code designed to perform some particular task, to be put into a single cell.

    "The aim of this Exercise is to implement the equations in the section on 2-D motion without drag.  **(a)** Write out pseudocode for this extended program.  **(b)** Now write the code itself, and encapsulate it in a Python function to which you can pass the initial velocity components $v_{xo}$ and $v_{yo}$, as well as the gravitational acceleration $g$, as arguments.  You might want your function to return both position and velocity components, as well as the time.  \n",

    "For the following parts of the Exercise, let $v_{xo} = 20$ m/s and $v_{yo} = 30$ m/s, and use the standard value $g = 9.80$ m/s$^2$.  **(c)** Make plots of $x$ vs. $t$ and $y$ vs. $t$ for the time period when the object is at or above \"ground level.\"  Do they look as you'd expect?  **(d)** Plot the $v_x$ vs. $t$ and $v_y$ vs. $t$ graphs as well.  Are they as expected?  **(e)** Make a plot of $y$ versus $x$, and eyeball (or compute in your code) both the height of the peak and the *range* of the motion (the horizontal distance from the launch point to the point in the descent at which the projectile returns to the launch height).  **(f)** Determine the same values analytically and check if they match the numerical results.  \n",

    "Modify your Python function of Exercise \\#3 for the case of motion in the presence of quadratic drag.  Design your function to take $C_D$, $\\rho$, $m$, and $A$ as additional arguments.  **(a)** Model the motion of a ball of mass $m = 3.0$ kg and radius $0.05$ m, and use the same initial velocity components and $g$ value that you used in the previous exercise: the aim is to compare the motions with and without drag.  (Reasonable values of the constants, in MKS units, are $C_D = 0.5$, and $\\rho = 1.3$ for air.)  Plot graphs of $x$ and $y$ vs. $t$, and $y$ vs. $x$ for the case with drag.  Also make a plot of $y$ vs. $x$ showing both curves, with and without drag.  (Make sure to display a legend.)  Briefly discuss how the two trajectories compare.  Is the one with drag symmetric?  What are the times-of-flight (from ground level back to ground level) for the two motions?  **(b)** Repeat the comparison (with and without drag) with $v_{xo} = 60$ m/s and $v_{yo} = 90$ m/s.  What do you conclude from comparing the results of parts (a) and (b)?  \\[***Hint:*** In both parts above, you can easily treat the case of no drag with your current function.\\]  \n",
