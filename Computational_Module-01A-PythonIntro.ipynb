    "You are about to start on a challenging but rewarding voyage (if you have not already done some computer programming)!  As mentioned in Module 0, because current computers are dumb we have to think as they do in order to get them to work for us.  Learning the algorithmic way of thinking needed to communicate with computers can be hard and frustrating at times, but take heart: with practice, you will learn to think their way and bend them to your will.  Achieving that ability can be very satisfying, as we hope you will find as you move into later modules in the sequence, when you will put your programming skills to use analyzing physically interesting problems.  For now, though, you need to develop the tools that will allow you to become a computer master."

    "Briefly, notebooks have **code cells** (that are generally followed by result cells) and **text** or **markdown cells**. The text cells are the stuff that you're reading now. The code cells start with `In [ ]:` with some number generally in the brackets. ***If you put your cursor in the code cell and hit Shift-Enter, the code will run in the Python interpreter and the result will print out in the output cell.*** You can then change things around and see whether you understand what's going on. (Note that after hitting Shift-Enter, the next cell down will become the active one.  Thus, <font color=\"red\">you can execute sequential cells simply by hitting Shift-Enter repeatedly</font>.  Hitting Shift-Enter in a **Markdown** cell -- one containing text, an image, or other media; basically anything other than code -- simply renders that content with whatever special formatting has been specified.)  You also can select \"Run all\" from the \"Cell\" menu item at the top of a notebook to run all of the cells in order.  \n",

    "<font color=\"red\">If you define a new variable, or load a library like `numpy`, or declare the plotting library `matplotlib` to run inline using `%matplotlib inline`, then once you execute the code cell in which those commands appear, they should be available to the entire notebook.</font>  Thus, it's sufficient to do those things just once in a notebook.  (One exception is the declaration of `matplotlib` as inline: if you do this somewhere other than the beginning of the notebook, it's possible that IPython will not know about it everywhere in the notebook.  So, if you anticipate doing any plotting in a notebook, it's a good idea to set up `matplotlib` in the first code cell, or not far below the first.)  The same comment applies to user-defined functions: once defined in a code cell that's been executed, user-defined functions are available elsewhere in the notebook."

    "Most IDEs (integrated development environments), including Anaconda, as well as the IPython implementation in Jupyterhub, provide a debugger that will display the sequence of function calls associated with an error.  Remember that when you run code, you usually \"call\" standard Python functions or functions from various libraries; those, in turn, often call other functions, leading to a long chain of function calls associated with the running of your code.  When an error is reported to you, the sequence of function calls shown in Jupyterhub appears in order -- your code containing the source of the error will appear at the top of the sequence; below that will be any immediate function that your code called, and below that will be the subsequent functions called in the chain of function calls.  So, to figure out what the original source of error is in your code, start at the top of the error message."

    "As an example, consider the code below which defines a function `plot_sqrt` to plot the square root of `x` over the range 0 to 9.  If we look at the bottom of the output, we see the error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'plot'`.   The meaning of this message is not important to us now, but note that it's arising in the line shown by the long (lower) arrow, where the code `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))` says to plot `x` versus its square root.  Above that section of the error message is another section containing a shorter arrow pointing to the line `plot_sqrt()`, which is our function.  So, to recap, the error message shows us that the error itself was in the line `ax.plot(x, sqrt(x))`, but that line was called by the function `plot_sqrt()`, so that sequence of function calls (first to `plot_sqrt`, then to `ax.plot`) is what the debugger gives us.  Generally, we care only about the *first* section of the message -- the location in our code of our original error -- and the *last* section, which identifies the actual error, which might give an idea of its cause."

First, the format characters start with a percent sign, and they end with one of several different letters. `%d` or `%i` are for printing out integers, `%f` is for floats, `%e` or `%E` are for numbers in exponential format (scientific notation). `%g` and `%G` generally print in the most compact decimal format, which may be exponential (using `e` or `E`, respectively).  \n",

Formats also can use an additional number after a decimal point to specify the number of decimal places to print.  In other words, `%N.nf` prints a float with `N` total digits and `n` digits after the decimal (so `N` must be greater than `n`).  (Note: if the total number of digits to be printed exceeds the specified value `N`, then all of the digits before the decimal point will be printed, as will `n` of the digits after the decimal point.  If the number has fewer than `N` total digits, then extra spaces will be printed before the number.)  There are other formatting strings, but the ones presented here are the most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second use of the percent sign is after the quoted string, to identify the set of variable values to replace the formatting characters.  For instance, in the first example the value `pi` replaces the `%d` characters, causing `pi` to be printed as an integer (which chops off the fractional part).   \n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass in multiple variables (if your formatting string contains multiple format specifications) by putting a group of variables in parentheses after the percent, as in the last example above, where `pi` is printed in compact form and `2*pi` is printed in exponential form.  \n",
