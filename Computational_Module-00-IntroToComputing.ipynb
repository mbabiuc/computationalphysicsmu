    "## Computational Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is the first in a series of computational modules designed to allow you to build up computational skills by working through the example problems in the modules, answering questions posed in the modules, and completing mastery exercises at the end of each module. Some modules, including this one, may require that you consult other resources for additional information. Modules that should be worked through prior to the one being read will be indicated under Prerequisite modules at the top of the first page of the module. Each module also indicates an estimated time range for reading the module and completing the exercises. If you have used Python before or have other computing experience, the lower end of the range may apply to you; if you have not had such experience, the upper end may be more applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to **Exercises** you also will find **Breakpoint questions** sprinkled throughout. \n",
    "In debugging environments for programming languages, breakpoints are markers that can be put into code to pause the execution of a program, enabling the programmer to inspect the values of variables and otherwise confirm that the program is doing what it is supposed to be doing at that point. \n",
    "The module Breakpoint questions are meant to serve a similar purpose: usually, they get you to pause in your reading, to think about what you've read in order to confirm that your brain is doing what it should be with the material at that point! \n",
    "The answers to the Breakpoint questions are provided at the end of each module."

    "## Why Learn Computer Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "For hundreds of years, progress was made in physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, etc. without the use of computers. \n",
    "However, as those fields evolved, the problems tackled by scientists grew more complicated and more challenging to solve, due either to the complexity of the systems involved or to the vast amounts of data that needed to be analyzed. \n",
    "The advent of electronic computers made it feasible to attempt to solve some of these problems. \n",
    "Nowadays, the computer is indispensable for applications ranging from genomics (e.g., the Human Genome Project), to computational chemistry (used, for example, to predict the molecular structures of potential new pharmaceutical drugs), to climate modeling (needed to assess the impacts of climate change), to the search for planets beyond our solar system, to modeling the formation of large-scale structure during the evolution of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides enabling scientists to address the very important applications listed above (and countless others!), learning computer programming is very valuable for another reason: it teaches the programmer to think in an algorithmic way. (Computers can “think” only in that way, at least for now, so we – the more mentally-adaptable “species” – are forced to adopt their mode of thought!) By algorithmic thinking we simply mean thinking according to an ordered, logical sequence of steps: a recipe is a good everyday example of an algorithm. \n",
    "Algorithmic thinking arguably is the best way to solve most scientific problems (apart, perhaps, from those situations in which intuition might be needed), so becoming more proficient at such thinking can help one become a more effective scientist. \n",
    "Developing your algorithmic thinking skills is, in fact, the primary purpose of these modules. Learning the tools of programming is a secondary (but very important) focus."

    "## Modern Computer Capabilities\n",

    "Computer speeds often are characterized in terms of flops (or FLOPS) – floating-point operations per second – where a floating point operation might be the addition of two floating-point numbers (numbers requiring a decimal representation, in contrast to integers). \n",
    "According to Wikipedia, a typical single-core processor in a laptop or desktop computer can perform roughly 10 billion floating-point operations per second; therefore, its speed would be rated at 10 gigaflops, or 1010 flops. As of this writing (Jan. 2015), the fastest computer in the world is located in China, and it has a speed of nearly 34 petaflops, or $3.4 \\times 10^{16}$ flops. It has been projected that an exaflop (1018 flops) computer will be built by 2019. Computing power in the 100-10000 teraflop ($10^{14}-10^{16}$ flops) range makes physically realistic simulations and analyses of structures and processes possible in reasonable time frames."

    "## Programming Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are instructed to do what we want them to do through the use of computer code, written in a programming language. \n",
    "The very earliest programmers used machine code to program their computers: it can be directly understood and executed by a computer's hardware, but is very difficult to program in. \n",
    "Modern “high level” programming languages readable by humans generally fall into two categories (although the distinctions between them are not precise). \n",
    "Compiled languages – e.g., some versions of Basic, C/C++, Fortran, and Java in some forms – are converted by compilers (other software) into machine code before the user's software is run. \n",
    "These languages tend to produce code that runs very fast – a boon to a programmer doing complicated calculations with large data sets. \n",
    "Their disadvantage is that one must “compile” the code before being able to run it. Interpreted languages – including Mathematica, MATLAB, and some other versions of Basic – use interpreters (other software) to translate the code into machine-executable form when the code is run: no pre-compilation is required. \n",
    "This approach allows the programmer to see the results of her program sooner, but leads to code that may not run as fast as compiled code. (As already noted, the distinctions between these two types of languages are not clear-cut, and there are other ways of coding that fall in between these two categories.) Python – the language used in these modules – actually employs a hybrid approach, so it is easy to see results quickly but the code also runs quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the compiled/interpreted language distinction, another important distinction associated with modern computing languages is the one between numeric and symbolic computing. \n",
    "As the name suggests, numeric computing involves the processing of actual numbers; e.g., the numerical derivative of $\\sin(x)$ would involve computing the differences between its values for nearby points $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$, with $x$ having particular values. \n",
    "Some modern languages also can perform symbolic computations; e.g. the symbolic derivative of $\\sin(x)$ would be reported as $\\cos(x)$, with no numbers involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a set of functions that one can call on (called \"sympy,\" for symbolic Python) that allow for symbolic computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind that computers are completely literal, no matter the programming language used. They operate based on precisely what you tell them, not on what they think you mean. If your code has an error in it, whether small or large, a computer will not understand and fix it. If you’re lucky, it will produce an error message; if you’re not, it simply will not do what you want it to, and you may not realize that.\n",
    "Therefore, in cases when incorrect output is not obvious, it's critical to test your code. A good way is to run it on data for which you know what the output should be. Don’t assume the output is right just because you get a result!"

    "## Starting with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For these modules, we will use Python as the main programming language. Its advantages are numerous: it is open-source (free) software, its syntax is easy to learn, it is an interpreted language that allows the user to see the code's output easily, it has extensions that enable one to do sophisticated interactive numerical analysis and visualization (similar to MATLAB and Mathematica), it is a widely-used language (including within the scientific/engineering community), and it is object-oriented. Moreover, a variant known as IPython has been developed which can be run in a browser-based format called a notebook. These notebooks can incorporate not only code, but also text, LaTeX, graphics, videos, and more.\n",
    "These modules are not meant to teach you the full Python language. Module 1 presents a brief introduction to Python, but it won't be all the information you will need for the modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are several versions of Python in common use. The 3.X versions differ from 2.7 (and earlier 2.X versions) in several ways, three of which are relevant to us: in the syntax of the print statement, which displays text or numeric output onscreen; in their treatment of integer division – the division of one integer by another; and in the behavior of the input statement, which receives input from a user. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these modules, we will assume use of version 3.X, but beware that some Python packages may not have every associated extension fully implemented.\n",

    "A string is just a set of characters, e.g. “time” or “x_init”; a floating point number can be thought of simply as a real number; and a boolean is True or False. \n",
    "In some languages, such as C, each variable must have its type “declared” at the beginning of the program, before it is used (e.g., int x declares x as an integer); however, the Python language is not “statically typed,” which means that when you need a variable you simply define it, and Python assumes its type or figures out what kind of variable it is from the definition. For example, x = 1 creates x as an integer, while x = 1.0 or x = float(1) creates it as a floating-point number.\n",

Higher level programming languages typically also allow the programmer to include comments, which the computer ignores. In Python, these are identified by a hash sign, # everything on a line following a hash is ignored.

    "## Tips on Learning Scientific Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules that follow this one deal with technical materials that may be a bit challenging to learn, depending on your prior experience with programming and algorithmic thinking more broadly. Here are some tips to keep in mind that might be helpful as you read and work through the exercises in the sequence of modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Technical writing cannot be read like a novel. You will need to read the same material more than once for the key ideas to become clear and understandable. In your first reading, you might want to simply skim the text to get a general overview of what it is presenting. On your subsequent readings you can progressively key in on finer details.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While reading, you might want to highlight or otherwise make note of what seem to be key terms and concepts. If you encounter a term you're not familiar with and its definition is not clear from the text, stop and look it up. While reading, it also could be very helpful to make notes on the passage. Imagine that you are going to give a mini-lecture to a fellow student – what would it be most important to tell them to make the material understandable? If you can identify the key ideas, you probably understand the material well yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "* When writing code, and especially when trying to debug it, it can be very helpful to get input from someone else. Just like it's hard to notice poor grammar or typographical errors in your own writing when you've read through it many times, it can be difficult to find bugs in your own code: you know what you want the code to do, and your brain sees that rather than what's actually there.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should feel free to work through the modules with other people, if that would be helpful!\n",
    "\n",
    "* When writing a big chunk of code, try to break it down into small, self-contained \"chunks.\" Get each of those working and test them with a reasonably broad (but relevant) set of inputs/ parameters, then combine the chunks appropriately to build the entire package. In this way, you can reduce the amount of code you have to search through to find a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There usually are many ways of coding a particular functionality. Don't worry at first about finding the \"best\" method: get something that works, and then you can think about refining it, if you have the time and the need for greater efficiency. That said, your code should be clearly organized, well-commented, and what it's doing should be clear to another programmer. If it's not, then chances are that after not looking at it for a while even you won't be able to figure out what it's doing."
